# Storage Fix for Avatar Upload Issues

## Problem

The error "The requested resource isn't a valid image" with `application/json` content type occurs when:

1. File uploads fail but the code still tries to generate a public URL
2. Corrupted files exist in the storage bucket
3. Storage policies are not properly configured

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added comprehensive validation in all avatar upload components
- Added file existence verification after upload
- Added URL validation to ensure uploaded files return image content
- Better error messages and logging

### 2. Storage Utilities

Created `lib/storage-utils.ts` with helper functions:

- `validateImageUrl()` - Checks if a URL returns valid image content
- `cleanupCorruptedAvatars()` - Removes corrupted files from storage
- `getValidAvatarUrl()` - Gets valid avatar URL with fallback

### 3. Enhanced Avatar Component

- Added automatic validation of avatar URLs
- Graceful fallback when images fail to load
- Prevents rendering of invalid images

### 4. Admin Cleanup Page

Created `/admin/cleanup-storage` page to:

- Clean up corrupted files from storage
- Provide a user-friendly interface for maintenance

## How to Fix the Current Issue

### Step 1: Clean Up Corrupted Files

1. Navigate to `/admin/cleanup-storage` in your app
2. Click "Clean Up Corrupted Files"
3. This will remove any files that return `application/json` instead of image content

### Step 2: Verify Storage Bucket Configuration

Ensure your Supabase storage bucket is properly configured:

```sql
-- Check if the avatars bucket exists and is public
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'avatars';

-- Verify storage policies
SELECT * FROM storage.policies WHERE bucket_id = 'avatars';
```

### Step 3: Test Upload Functionality

1. Try uploading a new avatar image
2. The enhanced error handling should prevent future corrupted uploads
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages

## Files Modified

1. `components/ui/avatar-upload.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
2. `components/profile-completion-form.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
3. `components/profile-edit-modal.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
4. `components/ui/avatar.tsx` - Added URL validation
5. `lib/storage-utils.ts` - New utility functions
6. `app/admin/cleanup-storage/page.tsx` - New admin page

## Prevention

The enhanced error handling will prevent this issue from occurring again by:

- Validating uploads before generating public URLs
- Checking file existence after upload
- Verifying image content type
- Providing clear error messages

## Troubleshooting

If you still see the error after cleanup:

1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify your Supabase environment variables are correct
3. Ensure your storage bucket policies allow public access
4. Check if your Supabase project has storage enabled

## Manual Cleanup (Alternative)

If the admin page doesn't work, you can manually clean up files in the Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to Storage in your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the "avatars" bucket
3. Delete any files that show 0 bytes or have suspicious names
4. Test the URLs directly in your browser to identify corrupted files
